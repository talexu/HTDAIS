Strip any 'www[0-9]*' found.  Use this rule to equate 
'http://www.archive.org/index.html' and 'http://www0001.archive.org/index.html' 
with 'http://archive.org/index.html'.  The resulting canonicalization
returns 'http://archive.org/index.html'.  It removes any www's or wwwNNN's 
found, where 'N' is one or more numerics, EXCEPT on URIs that have no 
path/query component.  Top-level 'slash page' URIs are left unstripped: we 
prefer crawling redundant top pages to missing an entire site only available 
from either the www-full or www-less hostname, but not both.  Operates on http 
and https schemes only.  Use StripWWWRule to strip a lone 'www' only (This rule 
is a more general version of StripWWWRule).
