ARCWriter processor.


path-description:
Where to save files. Supply absolute or relative path. If relative, files 
will be written relative to the order.disk-path setting. If more than one 
path specified, we'll round-robin dropping files to each. This setting is 
safe to change midcrawl (You can remove and add new dirs as the crawler 
progresses).
