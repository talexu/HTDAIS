Aggressive HTML extractor. Subclasses ExtractorHTML so does all that it does, 
except in regard to javascript blocks.  Here it first processes as JS as its 
parent does, but then it reruns through the JS treating it as HTML (May cause 
many false positives). It finishes by applying heuristics against script code 
looking for possible URIs.
