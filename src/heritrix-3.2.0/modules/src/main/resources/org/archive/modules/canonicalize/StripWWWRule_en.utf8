description:
Strip any 'www' found.
Use this rule to equate 'http://www.archive.org/index.html' and
 'http://archive.org/index.html'. The resulting canonicalization
 returns 'http://archive.org/index.html'.  It removes any www's
found, except on URIs that have no path/query component
('slash' pages).  Operates on http and https schemes only.
Use the more general StripWWWNRule if you want to strip both 'www'
and 'www01', 'www02', etc.
