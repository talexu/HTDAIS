description:
Strip known session IDs.  Use this rule to remove all of a set of known session 
IDs.  For example, this rule will strip JSESSIONID and its value from
'http://archive.org/index.html?JSESSIONID=DDDSSE233232333355FFSXXXXDSDSDS'.  
The resulting canonicalization returns 'http://archive.org/index.html'.
This rule strips JSESSIONID, ASPSESSIONID, PHPSESSID, and 'sid' session ids.
