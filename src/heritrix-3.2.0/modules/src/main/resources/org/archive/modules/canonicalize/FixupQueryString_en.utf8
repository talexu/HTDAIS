description:
Fixup the question mark that leads off the query string. 
This rule returns 'http://www.archive.org/index.html' if passed
'http://www.archive.org/index.html?'.  It will also strip '?&'
if '?&' is all that comprises the query string.  Also strips
extraneous leading '&': Returns 'http://archive.org/index.html?x=y
if passed 'http://archive.org/index.html?&x=y.
Will also strip '&' if last thing in query string.
Operates on all schemes.  This is a good rule to run toward the
end of canonicalization processing.
