description:
A QueuePrecedencePolicy that sets a uri-queue's precedence to a configured
single value. This value may vary for some queues (as in override 
settings sheets) or be changed by an operator mid-crawl (subject to limits 
on when such changes are noted in a uri-queues lifecycle).

base-precedence-description:
Integer value precedence to assign; default is 1.
