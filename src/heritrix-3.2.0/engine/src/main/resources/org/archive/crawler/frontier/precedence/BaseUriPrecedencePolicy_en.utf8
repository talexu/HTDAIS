description:
A UriPrecedencePolicy which sets a URI's precedence to a configured single
value. This value may vary for some URIs (as in override settings sheets) 
or be changed by an operator mid-crawl (but a URI is only assigned a 
precedence at its initial frontier enqueuing). 
 
base-precedence-description:
constant precedence to assign; default is 1
